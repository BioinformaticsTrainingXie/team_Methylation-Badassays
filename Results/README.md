This folder contains the main results for Methylation-Badsassays group.

There is a separate write up for each component of our analysis.

This folder contains the following writeups:

1. (Exploratory Analysis)[]

2. (Predictive Modeling)[]

3. (Functional Analysis)[]

4. (Differential Methylation Analysis)[]

And, we exported the [list]() of CpGs that were differentially expressed between Asians and Caucasians at an FDR of 0.01, the top 100 [list]() differentially methylated genes, and the [predictors]() that our glmnet model chose.
