This folder contains the main results for The Methylation-Badassays.

There is a separate write up for each component of our analysis.

This folder contains the following writeups:

1. [Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Results/Exploratory%20Analysis%20Write%20Up.md)
    
2. [Differential Methylation](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Results/Differential%20Methylation%20Analysis%20Write%20Up.md)
   
3. [Predictive Modeling]()
    
4. [Functional Analysis](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Results/Functional%20Analysis%20Write%20Up.md)

And, we exported the [list](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Results/limma_pval0.01_ancestry_accountingforGender.txt) of CpGs that were differentially expressed between Asians and Caucasians at a p value of 0.01, the top 100 [list](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Results/limma_top100_ethnicity_accountingforGender.txt) differentially methylated genes, and the [predictors](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Results/predictorsGlmnet.txt) that our glmnet model chose.
