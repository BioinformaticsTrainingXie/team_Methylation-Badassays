  There are no major changes to team members task. Some tasks will be assigned that are more specific than what was initially proposed. Such tasks are outlined below (and subject to change as the project progresses):
  
* Victor - Predictive Modeling Analysis (research on model selection, workflow, and coding)
* Ming - Predictive Modeling Analysis (research on model selection, workflow, and coding)
* Nivi - Exploratory Analysis - Github organization 
* Anni - Exploratory Analysis - Github organization / r markdown annotation
* Michael - Accessory (will help out wherever is needed)

 Everybody will help out on the poster.




### What is the progress of the analyses 

- **Since your initial proposal, you should have decided more concretely on what methods to use for each step of your analyses, and employed some of those methods.**

- **Briefly and concisely explain your methodology and progress for the aims you have investigated so far. Which parts were modified and which parts remained the same?**

- **What R packages or other tools are you using for your analyses?**

- **Provide the links to any markdown reports within your repo to refer to the relevant analysis.**
