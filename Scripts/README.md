### This folder contains the scripts for the project.

This folder contains the scripts used for processing raw data, and for the downstream analysis.

* Preprocessing: This [folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/tree/master/Scripts/Preprocessing) contains the [script](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Scripts/Preprocessing/PreprocessQC.md) to process raw data.
    
* Exploratory Analysis: This [folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/tree/master/Scripts/ExploratoryAnalysis) contain the [script](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Scripts/ExploratoryAnalysis/Exploratory.md) to identify differentially methylated CpG sites between Caucasians and Asians in placental tissue. 
    
* Differential Methylation Analysis: This [folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/tree/master/Scripts/Limma) contains the [script](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Scripts/Limma/Limma.md) for differential methylation analysis with limma.

* Predictive Modeling: This [folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/tree/master/Scripts/PredictiveModeling) contains scripts to use the identified CpG sites from glmnet to determine the genetic ancestry of [a second dataset](https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-016-0054-8) whose genetic ancestry is unknown.


* Functional Analysis: This [folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/tree/master/Scripts/FunctionalAnalysis) contains the [script](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Scripts/FunctionalAnalysis/FunctionalAnalysis.md) for mapping prioritized CpG sites to genes, chromosomes, and GO terms.
