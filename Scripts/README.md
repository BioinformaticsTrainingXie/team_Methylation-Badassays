### This folder contains the scripts for the project.

This folder contains the scripts used for processing raw data, and for the downstream analysis.

* [Preprosessing](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Scripts/Preprocessing/PreprocessQC.md):This [folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/tree/master/Scripts/Preprocessing) contains scripts process raw data to processed data.
    
* [Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Scripts/ExploratoryAnalysis/Exploratory.md): This [folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/tree/master/Scripts/ExploratoryAnalysis) contains scripts to identify differentially methylated CpG sites between Caucasians and Asians in placental tissue. 
    
* [Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Scripts/PredictiveModeling/PredictiveModeling.md): This [folder](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/tree/master/Scripts/PredictiveModeling) contains scripts to use the identified CpG sites from [Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Scripts/ExploratoryAnalysis/Exploratory.md) to determine the genetic ancestry of [a second dataset](https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-016-0054-8) whose genetic ancestry is unknown.
