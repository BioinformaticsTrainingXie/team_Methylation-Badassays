### This folder contains scripts for quality checks and processing rawdata to processed data.

We used the [Minfi package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/manuals/minfi/man/minfi.pdf), and the following [resource](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2015/BioC2015/methylation450k.html) to help guide our preprocessing.

Quality checks showed no glaring issues with the data set. 

We started out with 485512 CpG sites from the Illumina Infinium DNA Methylation BeadArrays and ended up with 464923 CpG sites after normalization.
