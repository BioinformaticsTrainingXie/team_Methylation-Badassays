## The Methylation Badassays

### Introduction:

DNA methylation (DNAm) is linked to many diseases like cancer and autism. However DNAm marks can change due to environmental stimuli, cell types and etc. Acutally, a large portion of DNAm variability is associated with genetic ancestry and is heritable. Differentially methylated CpG sites associated with pathology can ben confounded by CpGs associated with genetic ancestry causing suprious reuslts. To invetigate how DNA methylation affects prenatal health, it is important for us to identify genetic ancestry-associated CpGs to figure out true positives. Therefore, in this project we are going to investigate if DNA in placental tissue is differentially methylated across populations of different ethnicities. 

We will first find methylation profiles in a set of subjects with known genetic ancestry (Asians or Caucasians). These profiles will then serve as a basis to cluster methylation data in which genetic ancestry is not known.
