### Test Data

Because it is too large to put onto github, the test data is hosted on a private google drive link. Please send @wvictor14 a request for use.

The meta data for test data can be found [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Methylation-Badassays/blob/master/Data/Processed%20Data/Test%20data/metadata.GA_illumina_methylation.xls)

Information about dataset 2 can be found in this [link](https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-016-0054-8), and can be downloaded [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69502). There are 52 placental tissue DNA methylation (450k) samples that we use for our analysis.
